abstract: We identify members of 65 open clusters in the solar neighborhood using the machine-learning algorithm StarGO based on Gaia EDR3 data. After adding members of twenty clusters from previous studies (Pang et al. 2021a,b; Li et al. 2021) we obtain 85 clusters, and study their morphology and kinematics. We classify the substructures outside the tidal radius into four categories: filamentary (f1) and fractal (f2) for clusters $<100$ Myr, and halo (h) and tidal-tail (t) for clusters $>100$ Myr. The kinematical substructures of f1-type clusters are elongated; these resemble the disrupted cluster Group X. Kinematic tails are distinct in t-type clusters, especially Pleiades. We identify 29 hierarchical groups in four young regions (Alessi 20, IC 348, LP 2373, LP 2442); ten among these are new. The hierarchical groups form filament networks. Two regions (Alessi 20, LP 2373) exhibit global \"orthogonal\" expansion (stellar motion perpendicular to the filament), which  might cause complete dispersal. Infalling-like flows (stellar motion along the filament) are found in UBC 31 and related hierarchical groups in the IC 348 region. Stellar groups in the LP 2442 region (LP 2442 gp 1-5) are spatially well-mixed but kinematically coherent. A merging process might be ongoing in the LP 2442 subgroups. For younger systems ($\lesssim 30$ Myr), the mean axis ratio, cluster mass and half-mass radius tend to increase with age values. These correlations between structural parameters may imply two dynamical processes occurring in the hierarchical formation scenario in young stellar groups: (1) filament dissolution and (2) sub-group mergers.
