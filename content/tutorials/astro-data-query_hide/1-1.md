Mainly---as far as I know---there are two ways to get python. One is straight from [python.org](https://www.python.org). The other one is to install python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). The preferred one will be via Anaconda<sup>[1](#1)\*</sup> cause this helps us ease the pain of package management in the future.

## Anaconda
Go on to [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), and scroll down to find **Anaconda Installers**. The default python version should now be later than 3.7<sup>[2](#2)\*\*</sup>. If you are using Windows or Mac, feel free to install via the **graphical installer** (recommended for people without any knowledge about the command line/terminal). However, installation via the command line installer is much elegant and clean (default for Linux user).


### Installation via the command line (an example for Mac & Linux)
Right-click to copy the link for **command line installer**, then open the terminal and type `wget`<sup>[3](#3)\*\*</sup>, follow a space, then paste the url, e.g.,
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```
(make sure to copy the url from Anaconda web page to get the latest python version).\
After the download is finished, type `bash`, follow by a space, and then type the file name you just downloaded to start the installation, e.g.,
```bash
bash Anaconda3-2020.07-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

After the installation is done, type `python` and press Enter to see if you have something like this:
```python
Python 3.7.7 (default, Mar 26 2020, 10:32:53)
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
Make sure that your python version is later than 3.7.X, and with **Anaconda, Inc.** <sup>[&dagger;](#3)</sup>.
Type `exit()` to leave.

The benefit of installing via the command line is that you can get rid of the bulky UI, and open the ipython, jupyter lab/notebook IDE from the terminal faster. This effect can be more severe when you have a small RAM (<16GB), and less powerful CPUs.
