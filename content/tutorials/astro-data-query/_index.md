After going through this series of tutorials, you will learn basic skills to do astro-data analysis with `python`. We will start from the very beginning, installation of python (conda), and then step by step to help you get to a level to do basic cluster member selection. Another major part of this tutorial will be focusing on data visualization. Hope you enjoy.
