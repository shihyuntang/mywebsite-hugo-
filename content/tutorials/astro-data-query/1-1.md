Mainly---as far as I know---there are two ways to get python. One is straight from [python.org](https://www.python.org). Another one is to install python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). The preferred one will be via Anaconda<sup>[1](#1\*)</sup> cause this helps us ease the pain of package management in the future.


### Installation via conda
Go on to [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), and scroll down to find **Anaconda Installers**. The default python version now should be later than 3.7<sup>[1](#2\*\*)</sup>.
