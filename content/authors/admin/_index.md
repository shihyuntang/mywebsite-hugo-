Hi, I am Tang, Shih-Yun (湯士昀) from Taiwan, currently a Ph.D. student at the Rice University Department of Physics and Astronomy. I work with  Dr. [Lisa Prato](http://www2.lowell.edu/users/lprato/) at the Lowell Observatory and Prof. [Christopher Johns-Krull](http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~cmj/) at Rice using NIR and optical spectra to search for the youngest exoplanets around T Tauri stars. This project not only involves the development of a precision RV pipeline but also brings my focus to identify and isolate the star spot(s) induced RV signal on these young active stars. Meanwhile, as my side project, I am also working with Prof. Xiaoying Pang on using Gaia data to study stellar groups in the solar neighborhood.

I completed my B.A. and M.S. in Physics at the National Central University (NCU), Taiwan. My first research project was to characterize the stellar and substellar members in the Coma Berenices star cluster with Prof. [Wen-Ping Chen](https://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/~wchen/wp_chen/index.htm) as an undergraduate. Later, as my Master's thesis, I was the first to discover the tidal tails of the Coma Berenices star cluster.
